# HowFarFrom Distance Calculation App

This is a toy app used to compute travel times (in a car!) between an origin and multiple destinations. I built this primarily to quickly  assess how far a given house was from various points of interest (grocery stores, the airport, etc.) when searching for a house to buy.
